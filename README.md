# Project 1 â€“ Simple Linked List

## Overview
This project implements a **circular doubly linked list with a sentinel node** in C.  
It is the first project in the course and serves as a warm-up to practice:
- Pointers and dynamic memory management
- Structs and modular design in C
- Writing portable code that compiles in both **GitHub Codespaces** and **Onyx**
- Unit testing with the Unity framework


---

## Features
- Circular doubly linked list with a sentinel node
- Generic storage (`void *` for any data type)
- Append, insert, remove, and get functions
- Query functions: size, is_empty
- Optional `FreeFunc` to safely free stored elements
- Thorough unit testing with Unity
